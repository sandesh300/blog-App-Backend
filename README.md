# Blog App Web Application

## Introduction -
This project is a Blog App web application developed using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Spring Security, JWT Authentication, and MySQL. It provides users with functionalities to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, as well as authentication and authorization features to secure the application.

## Technologies -
- **Java**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based web applications.
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication, authorization, and other security features.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless authentication by generating and verifying tokens.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing application data.

## Features -
